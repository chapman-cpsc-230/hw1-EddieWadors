**Author:** _\<Eddie Wadors\>_

**Due date:** _\<2/18/16\>_

## Description

_\<Did examples out of the book, converted seconds to years, converted an interest rate problem to python, and debugged errors in some short programs given by the book.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<I learned how to use simple arithmatic in python, including learning about some objects like float and strings and how to use them correctly as well as converting variables in strings into the answer/english I want when running it. I also learned how to search for bugs in a given program by trying and trying again.\>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
